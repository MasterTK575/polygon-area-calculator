Create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.
When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with width and height attributes. Also it needs to have a variety of methods.

Process:

What I've learned:
1. Strip floats of their decimals by converting to int
2. How to represent objects as strings
3. Refresher on classes and objects; How to set init attributes
4. Refresher on creating methods for classes
